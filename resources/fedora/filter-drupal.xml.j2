<!--Place this file in $FEDORA_HOME/server/config

    Drupal connection info for the FilterDrupal servlet filter.  
    For multisite drupal installs you can include multiple connection elements.  
    We will query all the databases and assume any user in any drupal db with 
    the same username and password are the same user.  

    We will gather all roles for that user from all databases.  This is a 
    potential security risk if a user in one drupal database has the same 
    username and password as another user in a seperate drupal database.  -->
